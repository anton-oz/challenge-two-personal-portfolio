# Challenge Two Personal Portfolio

## Description

I made this website for potential employers to find information about me, my development work, and ways to contact me. While designing this website I learned that flexbox is very helpful for reacting to different display sizes in combination with ephemeral units and media queries. I also learned that building an application from scratch can get complicated quickly, and keeping in mind programming conventions such as DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) are vital not only for functionality, but also readable code. I am planning to add more to this site as I progress in my course, so stay tuned for more.
